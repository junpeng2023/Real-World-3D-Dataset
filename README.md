## A Real word 3D Dataset for Human-Robot Interaction 


## Description
This Dataset is a collection of 120 RGB-D videos, the 120 videos consist of 10 different scenarios, namely ”working”, ”flower”, ”coffee” and so on. All of which are designed to simulate the elderly's daily life under laboratory condition. Each scene has three modes:
”single person”, ”multi person” and ”cooperation”. There are five completely random action sequence videos in each mode. Compare to other existing state-of-the-art datasets, for the same scenario, we recorded not only the actions of a single person, but also recorded the collaboration between the two people, in order to improve the performance of humanoid robots.

## RGB-D Camera Setup

We use Intel RealSense Depth Camera D435i as RGB-D camera to record data. The Intel® RealSense™ D435i places an IMU into our cutting‑edge stereo depth camera. With an Intel module and vision processor in a small form factor, the D435i is a powerful complete package which can be paired with customizable software for a depth camera that is capable of understanding it's own movement.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
